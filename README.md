# NewsScrape

## Overview

The NewsScrape app scrapes the local section of the Star Tribune news website. After doing so, the user can display the articles scraped to the webpage. This allows the user to save the articles. The app allows users to filter their view to saved articles, where they can add personal notes to each article.

The app also provides links to each article on the Star Tribune website.

This app uses mongoDB to store the articles and notes.
